// Here we have async deferring wrappers using microtasks.

// In 2.5 we used (macro) tasks (in combination with microtasks).

// However, it has subtle problems when state is changed right before repaint

// (e.g. #6813, out-in transitions).

// Also, using (macro) tasks in event handler would cause some weird behaviors

// that cannot be circumvented (e.g. #7109, #7153, #7546, #7834, #8109).

// So we now use microtasks everywhere, again.

// A major drawback of this tradeoff is that there are some scenarios

// where microtasks have too high a priority and fire in between supposedly

// sequential events (e.g. #4521, #6690, which have workarounds)

// or even between bubbling of the same event (#6566).

/* not type checking this file because flow doesn't play well with Proxy */

// The nextTick behavior leverages the microtask queue, which can be accessed

// via either native Promise.then or MutationObserver.

// MutationObserver has wider support, however it is seriously bugged in

// UIWebView in iOS >= 9.3.3 when triggered in touch event handlers. It

// completely stops working after triggering a few times... so, if native

// Promise is available, we will use it:

/* istanbul ignore next, $flow-disable-line */

// In problematic UIWebViews, Promise.then doesn't completely break, but

// it can get stuck in a weird state where callbacks are pushed into the

// microtask queue but the queue isn't being flushed, until the browser

// needs to do some other work, e.g. handle a timer. Therefore we can

// "force" the microtask queue to be flushed by adding an empty timer.

// PhantomJS and iOS 7.x

// Fallback to setImmediate.

// Technically it leverages the (macro) task queue,

// but it is still a better choice than setTimeout.

// The template compiler attempts to minimize the need for normalization by

//

// For plain HTML markup, normalization can be completely skipped because the

// generated render function is guaranteed to return Array<VNode>. There are

// two cases where extra normalization is needed:

// 1. When the children contains components - because a functional component

// may return an Array instead of a single root. In this case, just a simple

// normalization is needed - if any child is an Array, we flatten the whole

// thing with Array.prototype.concat. It is guaranteed to be only 1-level deep

// because functional components already normalize their own children.

// 2. When the children contains constructs that always generated nested Arrays,

// e.g. <template>, <slot>, v-for, or when the children is provided by user

// with hand-written render functions / JSX. In such cases a full normalization

// is needed to cater to all possible types of children values.

/**
     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
     * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,
     * `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `conforms`, `constant`, `countBy`, `create`,

     * `difference`, `differenceBy`, `differenceWith`, `drop`, `dropRight`,

/**
     * Creates a debounced function that delays invoking `func` until after `wait`
     * milliseconds have elapsed since the last time the debounced function was
     * invoked. The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel
     * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.
     * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the
     * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked
     * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent
     * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`
     * invocation.
     *
     * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is
     * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function
     * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
     *
     * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred
     * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.

 * Command-like searching
 * ======================
 *
 * Given multiple search terms delimited by spaces.e.g. `^jscript .python$ ruby !java`,
 * search in a given text.
 *
 * Search syntax:
 *
 * | Token       | Match type                 | Description                            |
 * | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
 * | `jscript`   | fuzzy-match                | Items that fuzzy match `jscript`       |
 * | `=scheme`   | exact-match                | Items that are `scheme`                |
 * | `'python`   | include-match              | Items that include `python`            |
 * | `!ruby`     | inverse-exact-match        | Items that do not include `ruby`       |
 * | `^java`     | prefix-exact-match         | Items that start with `java`           |
 * | `!^earlang` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `earlang` |
 * | `.js$`      | suffix-exact-match         | Items that end with `.js`              |
 * | `!.go$`     | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.go`       |
 *
 * A single pipe character acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
 * query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either`go`, `rb`,
 * or`py`.
 *
 * ```
 * ^core go$ | rb$ | py$
 * ```
